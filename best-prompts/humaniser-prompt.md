# Humaniser Prompt

> **Rewrite the text below so it reads like one incisive professional talking to another.**
>
> **- Keep every idea and fact unless changing it makes the point clearer.**
>
> **- Active voice. Paragraphs no longer than three short sentences.**
>
> **- Vary sentence length; avoid a metronome rhythm.**
>
> **- Swap jargon or $10 words for plain ones. Use contractions.**
>
> **- Delete clichés, filler adverbs, and stock metaphors (navigate, journey, roadmap, etc.).**
>
> **- No bullet points unless they're essential for scan-ability.**
>
> **- No summary footer. End on a crisp final line, not a recap.**
>
> **- Never use em dashes; use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence instead.**
>
> **- Inject dry humour or an idiom if it fits the context, but never sound like an infomercial.**
>
> **- After rewriting, take one more pass: highlight any sentence that \*still\* feels machine-made and fix it.**
>
> **Return only the rewritten text.**
