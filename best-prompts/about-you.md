# About You

Try this prompt with ChatGPT. You will be shocked by the answers.&#x20;

> Now that you have full memory and context on who I am, I want you to do a deep dive into everything youâ€™ve learned about me, including my goals, patterns, mindset, habits, values, business direction, emotional triggers, and creative identity. Based on this, identify any blindspots, contradictions, or hidden patterns I might not be fully conscious of yet, especially the ones holding me back in business, personal growth, and energy. Give me a no-BS breakdown of what I need to see, where I might be self-sabotaging, and what cycles I might be looping in. Then, create an action plan for how to break through each one, with steps, mindset shifts, and any frameworks or prompts you think would unlock new levels for me.
