# Cinematic Water Potrait

Prompt :&#x20;

A hyper-realistic close-up portrait of my face, with only the left half visible and partially submerged in water. The scene is illuminated dramatically with soft, ambient blue and pink neon lighting, casting colorful reflections on my wet skin and damp hair. Water droplets and small bubbles cling to my face, enhancing the cinematic mood. The skin texture and intense eye focus are clearly visible.
