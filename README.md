#### What Prompt Engineering Really Means

Prompt engineering sounds complicated, but it’s really about asking questions thoughtfully. The better you frame your request, the better the response you get from AI.

Prompt engineering is:

* Asking the right questions
* Giving the right context
* Getting the right output

Think:\
❌ “Summarize Workday.”\
✅ “Summarize Workday in simple terms for tech support agents transitioning from UKG, focusing on time-off requests and schedule changes.”

It’s not about being technical. It’s about being intentional.
